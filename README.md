# SherdogScrapper

So, I'm a MMA fan, but since I'm based in Europe, I often watch fights the next day. And very often I don't have time to check who's fighting on the card, and doing this is scary because of possible spoilers. So I've decided to create an application which would parse for me who's fighting on the card and what is this fighter's resume without risking spoilers from the last night. Let's hope I'll finish this one soon ;)
